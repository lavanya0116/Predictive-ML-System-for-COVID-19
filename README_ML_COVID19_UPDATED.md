# 🧠 Predictive ML System for COVID-19

An end-to-end machine learning system that predicts COVID-19 infection risk based on user symptoms. It supports real-time data pipelines, automated model retraining, and visual dashboards.

## 🚀 Features
- COVID-19 symptom-based prediction using ML models (Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, SVM)
- Real-time data pipelines using Kafka and Apache Airflow
- Automated model tracking and retraining with MLflow
- FastAPI backend and React frontend with interactive dashboards
- Cloud-native deployment with Docker, Kubernetes (AWS/GCP)
- Alerts and notifications using Twilio
