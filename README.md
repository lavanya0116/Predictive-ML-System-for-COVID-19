# Predictive-ML-System-for-COVID-19
Built an end-to-end ML system to predict COVID-19 risk based on symptoms using regression and SVM. Used Kafka and Airflow for real-time data, MLflow for retraining, FastAPI backend, and React with Plotly for dashboards. Deployed with Docker/Kubernetes on AWS/GCP.
